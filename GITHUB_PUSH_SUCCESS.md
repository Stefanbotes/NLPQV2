## 🚀 What Happens Next (Automatic Vercel Deployment)

Vercel is now automatically detecting these changes and will:

### 1. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - Vercel webhook detects the new commits on master branch
   - Starts a new deployment build automatically
   - Build ID will be visible in Vercel dashboard

### 2. **Run Database Migration** ✨ NEW
   - **During build**, Prisma migration will run automatically
   - Creates all required tables in your PostgreSQL database
   - Migration file: `prisma/migrations/20251023_vercel_deployment_init/migration.sql`
   - Tables created: User, Account, VerificationToken, PasswordResetToken, EmailVerificationToken, Response, Assessment

### 3. **Build Next.js App**
   - Installs dependencies
   - Generates Prisma Client
   - Builds production bundle
   - Optimizes assets

### 4. **Deploy to Production**
   - App deployed to: https://nlpqv2.vercel.app
   - New deployment becomes live

## 👀 Monitor the Deployment

### **Vercel Dashboard**
Visit: https://vercel.com/stefanbotes-projects/nlpqv2/deployments

### **What to Look For:**

#### ✅ **Successful Build Indicators:**
```
✓ Installing dependencies
✓ Running prisma generate
✓ Running prisma migrate deploy  <-- DATABASE MIGRATION
✓ Building Next.js app
✓ Deployment ready
```

#### ⚠️ **Potential Issues to Watch:**

1. **Database Connection Errors:**
   ```
   Error: P1001: Can't reach database server
   ```
   **Solution:** Verify `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables

2. **Migration Errors:**
   ```
   Error: Migration failed
   ```
   **Solution:** Check migration SQL syntax, database permissions

3. **Build Errors:**
   ```
   Error: Build failed
   ```
   **Solution:** Check build logs for specific errors

## 🔍 Verify Deployment Success

### **1. Check Deployment Status**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, check:
- Status: "Ready" (green checkmark)
- Duration: ~2-3 minutes typical
- Logs: No errors in build/migration logs
```

### **2. Test Database Tables**
After deployment, verify tables were created:

**Option A: Vercel Postgres Dashboard**
- Go to: Storage → Postgres → Browse Data
- You should see all 7 tables listed

**Option B: Using Prisma Studio (locally)**
```bash
npx prisma studio --port 5556
```
*(Requires DATABASE_URL to be set locally to your Vercel database)*

### **3. Test the Live App**
Visit: https://nlpqv2.vercel.app

**Test These Features:**
- ✅ Home page loads correctly
- ✅ Sign up page accessible
- ✅ Email verification works (emails sent)
- ✅ Database operations work (create account, save data)

---

## 📧 Email Configuration Status

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Gmail SMTP credentials configured in Vercel
- ✅ Environment variables set:
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`
  - `EMAIL_FROM`
- ✅ NextAuth configured for email provider

### **Expected Email Behavior:**
1. User signs up → Verification email sent via Gmail SMTP
2. User receives email from: `noreply@nlpqv2.app`
3. Email contains magic link for verification
4. User clicks link → Account verified → Can log in

### **Testing Email Delivery:**
```bash
# After deployment, try signing up with a real email address
# Check your inbox (and spam folder) for verification email
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### **If Migration Fails:**

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs:**
   ```
   Vercel Dashboard → Your Deployment → Build Logs
   Search for: "prisma migrate"
   ```

2. **Manual Migration (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable locally
   export DATABASE_URL="your_vercel_database_url"
   
   # Run migration
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

3. **Verify Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db pull
   ```

### **If Emails Don't Send:**

1. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Check all email variables are set

2. **Check Gmail App Password:**
   - Ensure App Password is valid (not expired)
   - Test manually with a simple SMTP script

3. **Check Build Logs for Email Errors:**
   ```
   Search for: "email", "smtp", "nodemailer"
   ```

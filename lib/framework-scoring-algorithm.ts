// Framework-Compliant Persona Scoring Algorithm
// Implementation of the Complete Report Framework Guide
// 
// ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE: This persona-based scoring approach is being replaced
// by the new shared schema-based scoring system (shared-schema-scoring.ts) which:
// - Uses shared LASBI mapping loader for consistency with Studio
// - Implements unrounded scoring with proper tie-breakers  
// - Eliminates hardcoded arrays and fragile mappings
// - Provides better accuracy and Studio parity
//
// This file is kept for backward compatibility but new development should use
// the shared schema scoring approach.

# Email Configuration Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Task:** Gmail SMTP setup documentation for Vercel deployment

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Analyzed Email Configuration

Reviewed the app's email implementation in:
- `/lib/email-service.ts` - Email sending service using Nodemailer
- `/lib/auth-config.ts` - NextAuth authentication configuration

**Found email features:**
- ✉️ Email verification for new user registrations (24-hour token)
- 🔑 Password reset emails (15-minute token)
- ✅ Password change confirmation emails
- 🎨 Professional HTML email templates with mobile-responsive design

### 2. Identified Required Environment Variables

The app uses these **exact** variable names (not EMAIL_SERVER_*):

| Variable | Required | Purpose | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Yes | Mail server address | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Yes | Mail server port | `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | Yes | Gmail email address | `yourname@gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Yes | Gmail App Password | `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | No | Sender email (defaults to SMTP_USER) | `noreply@yourdomain.com` |
| `EMAIL_DEBUG` | No | Debug mode (logs instead of sending) | `true` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Yes* | App URL for links in emails | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |

*Already configured in your deployment

## 🔍 Important Findings

### Correction: Variable Names

**❌ Previous documentation incorrectly showed:**
```env
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT  
EMAIL_SERVER_USER
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
```

**✅ App actually uses:**
```env
SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASS
```

The new guides use the **correct variable names** that match the code.

### Email Flow Explanation

**Registration:**
1. User submits registration form
2. Account created (emailVerified = false)
3. Verification token generated (secure, 24-hour expiry)
4. Email sent via Gmail SMTP with verification link
5. User clicks link → emailVerified = true
6. User can now log in

**Password Reset:**
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Reset token generated (secure, 15-minute expiry)
3. Email sent via Gmail SMTP with reset link
4. User clicks link → Can set new password
5. Confirmation email sent

### Security Features

The email service includes:
- 🔒 Secure token generation and hashing
- ⏰ Token expiration (24h for verification, 15m for reset)
- 🛡️ XSS protection in email templates
- 🔐 App Password requirement (not regular password)
- 📝 Audit logging in Vercel
- 🚫 Debug mode for development (doesn't send real emails)
